# The Qiankun System: High-Fidelity DNA Medium-Enabled Information Communication Secured by the Nested Yin-Yang Codec System

The DNA storage is a promising technology for large-scale information archving technology, but high error rate, about 0.1 ~ 1 %, challenges getting error free information from DNA oligonucleotides. The Qiankun system is a DNA storage encoding and decoding system designed to handle Indel errors with a single read. 

### Main idea of the Qiankun system


### Performance of The Qiankun system
We have done simulations to check the performance of the Qiankun system. The expectation of reads depth is 1.06 when the error rate is 3.6%.
